    "Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python. In this assigment you'll explore how to train decision trees using the `scikit-learn` library. The scikit-learn documentation can be found [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html).\n",

For this task we'll be using the Diabetic Retinopathy data set, which contains 1151 instances and 20 attributes (some categorical, some continuous). You can find additional details about the dataset [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set)."
